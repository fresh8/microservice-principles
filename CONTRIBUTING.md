# How to Contribute

Other peoples different opinions and areas of expertise are what make Fresh8 Gaming great, and contributions to our practices and principles are very important. We want it to be as easy as possible for anyone to contribute to these, and help us progress and change for the better. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the `master` branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on `master`, run `git checkout -b my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical and atomic units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with git diff --check before committing.

##Â Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the [fresh8 organization](https://github.com/fresh8/microservice-principles).
* All discussion on a new principle, or a change to existing principles, should happen on the pull request created in the repository.
* Pull requests will be discussed in a monthly meeting that will be accessible to engineers via a Google Meet, which will be recorded with any required actions commented on the pull request directly.
* After feedback has been given we expect responses within a week. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
